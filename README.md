- rotate270CCW()
- horizontalFlip()
- verticalFlip()
- drawOnCanvas(canvas)
- drawHistogram(canvas_r, canvas_g, canvas_b, canvas_avg)
- brightness(value)
- contrast(value)
- equalization()
- umbralization(min, max)
- saveFile(callback)
- scale(width, height, 'interpolation|neighbor')
- drawOnCanvasWithZoom (canvas, zoomValue, 'interpolation|neighbor')
- rotate(angle)
- kernel(width, height, customKernel?)
- blur('box|gauss')
- edge('prewitt|sobel')

### How to use
I prepared a code to interact with library, you only need to clone the repository, and open `index.html` in **src/views/**, using a modern browser.
The same view is located on github repository page, [mentioned in the end of this markdown](#demo).

To use the library in your own context, only need:

Import in your typescript file the library:

```javascript
import {Bitmap} from "./bitmap";
```

Call the constructor and read:
```javascript
let bmp: Bitmap = new Bitmap(file);
// file is a File Type
bmp.read(file, (b: Bitmap) => {
  // bmp and b is the same instance
  // The file was read. Now, you can use the functions
});
```
And that's all.

##### Drawing on Canvas:
Every time that you want to see the changes on your canvas, you have to call `drawOnCanvas(canvas)`
```javascript
let canvas = document.getElementById("canvas_id");
let bmp: Bitmap = new Bitmap(file);
bmp.read(file, (b: Bitmap) => {
  b.drawOnCanvas(canvas);
});
```
Also, is important to specify a size of you canvas:
```html
<canvas id="canvas_id" width="500" height="500">
```
**NOTE: Canvas can be very slow for big files, it is not the best solution to display a bmp file in HTML. Open a issue if found a faster solution.**

##### Drawing Histogram:
Now is possible draw image's histogram, for the moments you have to pass 4 canvas, the first three are for RED, GREEN and BLUE. The last is the average between 3 channels (R, G, B). If the image is grayscale type, only average histogram will be shown. If is the image has color, R,G,B histograms will be shown.
### Dependencies
RequireJS in needed to allow exports and import Bitmap module.
```html
<script data-main="../../build/main.js" src="../../lib/require.js"></script>
```

FileSaver is required, it allows to write a DataView in Blob.
```html
<script src="../../lib/FileSaver.min.js"></script>
```
